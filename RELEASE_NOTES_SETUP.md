# Release Notes Website Setup

## Overview

The release notes agent has been successfully modified to publish all release notes to the `release-notes-website` branch. This setup creates a dedicated website for hosting release notes with automatic updates.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Modified Release Notes Agent (`agents/release_notes.toml`)

**Key Changes:**
- **Branch Publishing**: Agent now switches to `release-notes-website` branch before generating files
- **Folder Structure**: Creates a `release-notes` folder for all release note files
- **Index Updates**: Automatically updates `index.html` to reference new release notes
- **Git Workflow**: Includes proper git commands for staging, committing, and pushing changes

**New Workflow:**
1. Switch to `release-notes-website` branch
2. Create `release-notes` directory if it doesn't exist
3. Generate markdown and HTML release notes files
4. Update `index.html` with new release note entry
5. Stage all changes with `git add`
6. Commit with descriptive message
7. Push to `release-notes-website` branch

### 2. Updated GitHub Workflow (`.github/workflows/release-notes.yaml`)

**Enhanced Features:**
- **Branch Management**: Automatically creates `release-notes-website` branch if it doesn't exist
- **Proper Checkout**: Switches to the correct branch before making changes
- **File Staging**: Stages both `release-notes/` folder and `index.html`
- **Branch-Specific Push**: Pushes changes to `release-notes-website` branch

### 3. Release Notes Website Structure

**Branch: `release-notes-website`**
```
├── index.html              # Main website page
└── release-notes/          # Folder containing all release notes
    ├── release-notes-v0.1.128.md    # Markdown version
    ├── release-notes-v0.1.128.html  # HTML version
    └── ...                          # Future release notes
```

### 4. Index.html Features

**Current Capabilities:**
- **Release Notes Listing**: Displays all available release notes in cards
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Modern UI**: Clean black and white design with Font Awesome icons
- **Direct Links**: Links to individual HTML release notes pages
- **Loading States**: Shows loading spinner and empty states
- **Version Badge**: Displays current version

**Dynamic Updates:**
- The `fetchReleaseNotes()` function returns an array of release note objects
- Each new release automatically updates this function
- Cards are generated dynamically with title, date, summary, and link

## How It Works

### For New Releases

1. **Trigger**: When a new release is published on GitHub
2. **Agent Execution**: Release notes agent runs with the new version
3. **Branch Switch**: Agent switches to `release-notes-website` branch
4. **File Generation**: Creates both `.md` and `.html` files in `release-notes/` folder
5. **Index Update**: Updates `index.html` to include the new release
6. **Git Operations**: Commits and pushes all changes to the branch

### For Website Visitors

1. **Access**: Visit the `release-notes-website` branch (can be hosted via GitHub Pages)
2. **Browse**: View the main index page with all release notes
3. **Navigate**: Click on any release note to view the detailed HTML version
4. **Responsive**: Works seamlessly on all devices

## File Structure

### Release Notes Files
- **Markdown**: `release-notes/release-notes-{VERSION}.md` - Source format
- **HTML**: `release-notes/release-notes-{VERSION}.html` - Web-ready format

### Index Updates
The agent automatically updates the `fetchReleaseNotes()` function in `index.html`:

```javascript
async function fetchReleaseNotes() {
    return [
        {
            title: "Release Notes v1.2.3",
            date: "2024-12-15",
            summary: "Brief description of the release",
            link: "release-notes/release-notes-v1.2.3.html"
        },
        // ... other releases (sorted by date, newest first)
    ];
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Centralized**: All release notes in one dedicated location
2. **Automated**: No manual intervention required for updates
3. **Professional**: Clean, modern website design
4. **Accessible**: Easy to browse and search through releases
5. **SEO-Friendly**: Proper HTML structure for search engines
6. **Mobile-Ready**: Responsive design for all devices
7. **Fast Loading**: Lightweight design with minimal dependencies

## Testing

A sample release note (v0.1.128) has been created to demonstrate the functionality:
- **Files Created**: Both markdown and HTML versions
- **Index Updated**: Main page now shows the release note card
- **Links Working**: Direct navigation to the detailed release notes

## Next Steps

1. **GitHub Pages**: Enable GitHub Pages for the `release-notes-website` branch
2. **Custom Domain**: Optionally set up a custom domain for the release notes site
3. **Analytics**: Add analytics tracking if desired
4. **Search**: Consider adding search functionality for large numbers of releases

## Usage

The system is now ready for production use. When the next release is published:

1. The GitHub workflow will automatically trigger
2. The release notes agent will generate new files
3. The website will be updated with the new release notes
4. Users can immediately access the updated information

This setup provides a professional, automated solution for maintaining and displaying release notes with minimal maintenance overhead.
